_beeSpaces_ is a service for provisioning Teams and SharePoint environments 
according to a companies needs using [PnP-Provisioning-Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/pnp-provisioning-tenant-templates/) 
and other interfaces.

By default, a handy _Wizard_ is available on the target SharePoint environment. 
However, sometimes a deeper integration into the company automation processes 
is required and a direct usage of the service API preferred.

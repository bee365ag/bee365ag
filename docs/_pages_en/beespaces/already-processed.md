The _Space_ has already been extended or approved for archiving by another user.

When a provisioned _Space_ reaches the end of its lifespan, _beeSpaces_
sends a notification to all owners of the _Space_ with possible actions.
Each owner has now the possibility to choose one of the actions, where
only the first choice is executed. Further actions cannot be processed
and lead to a conflict.

To revert an action, an administrator has to reset the settings of the _Space_.

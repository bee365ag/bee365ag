*beeIO* is an integration and automation platform for service providers. It connects multiple systems and environments through a standardized API approach and connects providers and buyers of IT services together.

Any endpoint can typically consume or provide data in a given setting and is logically organized in a certain environment.


## Service Scope / «operational agreements» (non-technically)
*beeIO* as a dedicated platform for service transactions and from a conceptual perspective a well-defined business-scenario, is subject to certain definitions of «operational agreements». The scope of these agreements is non-technically, but basically come into effect in a context of  partnership cooperation between bee365 and its regular partners. Hence, the following «service limitations» are well-defined boundaries of business scenarios in which beeIO and its service transactions can be used as a solution candidate:

Provided by at least one *environment connector*, …
* data and data objects from a service transaction connect to any defined service within the Microsoft 365 platform
* data and data objects from a service transaction connect to any defined management endpoint within the Microsoft 365 platform
* data and data objects from a service transaction connect to a defined service of the Microsoft Power Platform (such as Power Apps, Dataverse, Power Virtual Agents, Power Automate)
* data and data objects from a service transaction connect to any defined service of any beeProduct (such as beeIO itself, beeSpaces, beeConnect and all others)

bee365 guarantees compliance with the «operational agreements» (listed above) for all orders and scenarios of the ordering party.
Exceptions, in which the defined «operational agreements» are deliberately violated, require without exception a written request by the customer itself to the parties concerned. 

The responsibility for the whole content of a transaction service always relates to the ordering party.
